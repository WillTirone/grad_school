Below answers were found by running the script in hw8_number_1.py and then loading the dataframe in the research environment, hw9.ipynb. 
Then I took the IV and "LastPrice" as the price for each. (no backtest provided as no trades took place).

Use linear interpolation to find the implied volatility at 2022-10-17 13:00:00 for an OTC Put option struck at 128.25 with expiry of 2022-12-16.

Here, used numpy's np.interp and the same structure as the above two options. 
I used the following code to bracket the $128.25 price. I couldn't seem to pull [$128, $129] strikes, 
so I used [$125, $130] which will make the interpolation less accurate but should still be close. Calculated 
specifically in hw8.ipynb.

My general strategy was to find the call ATM that I wanted to trade, compute the rolling 25-day sigma, and place orders based on the current IV of 
the contract and historical volatility. This resulted in a profit of 12% from 11/1 - 11/18. I also stopped trading the day before expiration since 
delta = 0 on the day of expiration. I also placed orders using the options as 5% of my portfolio.
