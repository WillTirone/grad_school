(10 pts) Write an algorithm on QC to compute the max, min and average for the rolling 120-day 
autocorrelations (with lag =3, and non-overlapping 3-day periods) for each of these stocks. (Hint: use pandas slicing method [::3])


I had to use a 40 day rolling window in an attempt to get the autocorrelations to calculate. 
It doesn't seem like our date range was wide enough to make 120 days possible. 
Many other people were confused on the Ed discussion board so submitting my attempt anyway.

ROKU has the highest max autocorrelation at 0.6089899610665084 and AMD has the 
smallest min autocorrelation at -0.48412898202100624. This was done in the hw3 folder under 3.1.ipynb.


(5 pts) Find the stock (called S1) with the highest max autocorrelation and design a 
trendfollowing momentum strategy that is based on indicator SMA(20). 
The portfolio weight to be 50% of the portfolio value. Find the Sharpe Ratio and Drawdown 
during the backtest period. (Hint: self.SetHoldings method)

S1 = ROKU

Sharpe = -0.174
Drawdown = 36.400%

(5 pts) Find the stock (called S2) with the lowest min autocorrelation and design a 
trend-reversal momentum strategy that is based on indicator SMA(20). The portfolio weight 
to be 50% of the portfolio value. Find the Sharpe Ratio and Drawdown during the backtest period.

S2 = AMD

Sharpe = -0.52
Drawdown = 27.200%

(10 pts) Combine #2 and #3 into a new trading strategy involving both S1 and S2, and the 
same momentum indicator. The portfolio weight for S1 and S2 are 25%. Find the Sharpe Ratio 
and Drawdown during the backtest period.

Sharpe = -0.43
Drawdown = 25.300%

(5 pts) Compare the size of the drawdown for #3 and #4 and explain why the result makes sense.

#4 has a slightly smaller drawdown compared to #3. I think this is because we combined trend 
reversal and trend following with two stocks that are probably somewhat correlated (not calculated here but both tech stocks), 
it provided a moderate amount of diversification and lowered drawdown. I imagine if we made the two stocks very unrelated, 
like an energy and a tech stock, the drawdown would be even smaller. Out of curiosity, I tried with JPM instead of AMD 
and the drawdown was 27%, in fact higher than the two tech stocks.
