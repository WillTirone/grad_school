Unrealized P/L: $ -982.42

Strategy: I used the usual pairs trading strategy general idea, but placed slightly more restrictive risk management controls to 
hopefully protect against downside and prevent margin calls. I liquidated if margin was less than $20,000 and also liquidated if the z-score
was greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, it was the same as the pairs trading strategy we saw in class and in homeworks.

Errors: I didn't have any code errors that stopped the code, just the couple of QC-wide outages that shut down most of our live trading. It seemeed
to run smoothly otherwise, though. The bug near March 3rd was the QC-wide shut down.
