## Background

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly series of curated data and analysis projects that are run as part of the R4DS online learning community. For this week's assignment we will be looking at one of their selected data sets with an eye towards creating effective visualizations that tell an interesting story.

Specifically, for this assignment we will be looking at a data set collected by the Economist for their November 24th 2018 article on [TV's golden age](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/11/24/tvs-golden-age-is-real). These data are included in your repository in `data/IMDb_Economist_tv_ratings.csv` and they include details on all TV dramas available via IMDb from 1990 to 2018. These data were originally published on the Economist's [graphic detail data repo](https://github.com/TheEconomist/graphic-detail-data).


## Task 1 - Goals

After examining the data and conducting some exploratory data analysis come up with an overarching goal of what can be conveyed to a reader using these data. This goal does not need to be the same as the goal of the Economist's writer, feel free to do whatever you would like with these data (including supplementing them with outside sources, subsetting, etc.). Clearly describe your goal(s) for your visualization.

## Task 2 - Visuals

Now you will create a visualization that meets the goals you described in Task 1. This visualization should tells an interesting story and / or provide insights into the underlying data. There is no single correct answer for these data and your visualization should depend on what your ultimate goal is for a reader. You should read the data into R using a reproducible workflow and avoid directly editing or manipulating the `csv` file. You are welcome to use any R package you would like for producing your visualization.

## Task 3 - Designs

Provide a brief write-up describing your design choices for your visualization. Your answer should touch on why your visualization is an effective solution for achieve the goal(s) you descreibed in Task 1.

## Submission and Grading

This homework is due by *5:00 pm Friday, October 7th*. You are to complete the assignment as a team and to keep everything (code, write ups, etc.) in your team's repository. The final product for this assignment should be a single qmd document (a template of which is provided in your repo) that contains all code and text for the tasks described above. This document should be clearly and cleanly formatted and present all of your results. Style and formatting does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your text and code are properly formatted and your visualization is readable. This document must be reproducible and I must be able to compile it with minimal intervention - documents that do not compile will be given a 0.
