# grad_school
(almost) everything I did in grad school. Note that I removed most of the datasets and some of the rendered pdfs because of size constraints. Most of this is in R, with a mix of Python and MATLAB as well. 

## [Algorithmic Trading](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/algo_trading) 

A class on algorithmic methods applied to stock market trading. This repo contains homework. Our final project, which used gradient boosting and fundamental stock selection can be viewed [here](https://github.com/WillTirone/algo_trading). We won our in-class trading competition with this approach!

## [Bayesian Inference](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/bayesian_inference/homework) 

Duke Statistical Science is a very Bayesian-heavy department, so we spent a significant amount of time learning various Bayesian methods including MCMC.

## [Classical Inference](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/classical_inference) 

This includes homeowkr from classical inference, as well as the two most difficult exams I've ever taken.

## [Geospatial and Time Series Statistics](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/geospatial_statistics) 

Study of geospatial models and time series, including AR, ARMA, ARIMA, CAR, SAR, and Gaussian Process models.

## [Hierarchical Models](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/hierarchical_models) 

A course that combined frequentist and Bayesian approaches to building hierarchical models. There were two projects, which are in separate repositories: 

1. [Case Study 1](https://github.com/WillTirone/610_case_study) An exploration of self-reported drug pricing data.
2. [Case Study 2](https://github.com/WillTirone/610_cs2) An examination of NC election data. You can view my presentation on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VowcD-4osUU&t=120s). 

## [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/probabilistic_ML)

A class on the statistical and probabilistic underpinnings of machine learning. 

1. [Our final project](https://github.com/WillTirone/STA561/tree/main/project), applying machine learning methods to predict fish biomass levels.

## [Statistical Computing](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/statistical_computing) 

A course in R.

## [Statistical Learning (Machine Learning)](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/statistical_learning/homework) 

The most difficult class I've ever taken. I learned a tremendous amount, though! I completed two projects which are in separate repos: 

1. [Project 1](https://github.com/WillTirone/521/tree/main/projects/proj1): Improved plots from a published paper, and then applied various machine learning methods to better understand the health of the trees. 
2. [Project 2](https://github.com/WillTirone/521_proj2): A classification task to predict the presence of clouds vs. ice in satellite images of the arctic.

## [Study Design](https://github.com/WillTirone/grad_school/tree/main/study_design) 

A class examining different sampling techniques, study and survey design, and a brief introduction to causal inference.
