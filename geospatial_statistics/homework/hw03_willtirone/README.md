# Sta 344 / 644 - Homework 3 

Due Monday, October 30th by 5:00 pm

## Submission and Marking

You are to complete the assignment using the provided GitHub repository - everything (code, derivations, write ups, etc.) must be included in the repository. Only the work committed to the repositories' **main** branch by the deadline will be graded - commit early and often.

The final product for this assignment should be a single qmd document (`hw1.qmd`) that contains all code and/or text for the questions in the document. Your assignment should be clearly and cleanly formatted and present all of your results. Style and formatting does count for this and future assignments, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your text and code are properly formatted. The course expectation is that all assignments should be reproducible, i.e. *we* should be able to render it with minimal intervention - documents that do not render may be penalized.

Note that your repository includes some basic automated feedback tools implemented with GitHub actions, the results of these will be visible on GitHub via the badges at the top of this README or via your repo's Actions tab. These are meant to give you feedback around the structure and reproducibility of your repository and assignment - they do not assess the correctness of your work. You should consider them a necessary but not sufficient condition when turning in your work - passing all of the checks simply means your have met our standard of reproducibility for the assignment.
