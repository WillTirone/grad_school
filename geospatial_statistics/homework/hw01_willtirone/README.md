Sta 344 / 644 - Fall 2023 - Homework 1
----------

Due Friday, September 22nd by 5 pm.

## Submission and Marking

You are to complete the assignment using the provided GitHub repository - everything (code, derivations, write ups, etc.) must be included in the repository. Only the work committed to the repositories' **main** branch by the deadline will be graded - commit early and often.

The final product for this assignment should be a single qmd document (`hw1.qmd`) that contains all code and/or text for the questions in the document. Your assignment should be clearly and cleanly formatted and present all of your results. Style and formatting does count for this and future assignments, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your text and code are properly formatted. The course expectation is that all assignments should be reproducible, i.e. *we* should be able to render it with minimal intervention - documents that do not render may be penalized.

Note that your repository includes some basic automated feedback tools implemented with GitHub actions, the results of these will be visible on GitHub via the badges at the top of this README or via your repo's Actions tab. These are meant to give you feedback around the structure and reproducibility of your repository and assignment - they do not assess the correctness of your work. You should consider them a necessary but not sufficient condition when turning in your work - passing all of the checks simply means your have met our standard of reproducibility for the assignment.


### Quarto?

We will be using Quarto for all of this course's assignments this semester. Quarto is designed to be the next step in scientific and technical publishing, and it builds directly on the foundation of RMarkdown. If you have used RMarkdown in a previous class then Quarto will look and behave almost identically (slightly different front matter, render button instead of knit in RStudio, etc.). Practically, each assignment will contain a templated Quarto document with clear indications as to where you should include your text, math, and or code. 

Excellent documentation and examples are provided by the Quarto website at [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/).

### Code styling

We will not be enforcing any particular coding style, however it is important that the code you produce is *readable* and *consistent* in its formatting. There are several R style guides online, e.g. from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and from the [tidyverse team](https://style.tidyverse.org/) that are a good place to start.

### Mathematical derivations and related work

Quarto documents fully support the inclusion of [LaTeX equations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations), see the course slides for extensive examples of this. Our preference is that for any question that asks for derivations or other mathematical work you include that work as LaTeX equation(s).

If this is too burdensome or you are not comfortable with LaTeX you are also welcome to handwrite this work and then include a *legible* image of the work in your document. The image will need to be committed to your repository and the image embedded in the qmd document (see [Figure Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#figure-basics)). Using a physical scanner or scanning app on your phone (e.g. Adobe Scan) will go a long way to producing the most legible version of your work.

We ask that you only do this more mathematical work and not for any written text, the latter must be included as typed text in the document.
